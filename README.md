# Collecting information for PDB deposition

Given the number of data and metadata already in MyTardis for protein
structure solutions through x-ray crystallography, this app attempts to
collect the appropriate ones and prefills the standard information 
document required for deposition of new protein structures to the 
Protein Data Bank

## Information available

### People
contact_author_PI has name and surname in MyTardis
structure_authors are the authors associated with any experiment

### Technical information
auto-entered data from the Synchrotron may include some of the following
information

* radiation source
* radiation type/beamline
* detector type

In the future these will be expanded thanks to further user entered data
entry and closer ties with data sources.
